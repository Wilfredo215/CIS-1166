#Mathematical Concepts in Computing project

1. Given the binary code, determine the number of errors that it can detect and the number of errors that it can correct

2. Given a binary code with minimum distance k, where k is a positive interger, write a program that will detect errors in codewords in as many as k - 1 positions and correct errors in as many as |_(K - 1)/2_| positions.
